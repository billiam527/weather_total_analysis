#weather_total_analysis

This was a quick analysis on whether the temperature affects the total of NFL games.  My findings are as follows:

1) The mean total of an NFL game for data ranging between 1966 and 2017 is ~41
2) The mean temperature for a game is 55 degrees F
3) In games that are at the extremes of the temperature range, there appears to be some correlation between temperature and score
4) When the temp < 15, the average score is 39 and the median is ~37
5) When the temp > 87, the mean score is 42 and the median is 44
6) The problem with this analysis is that the sample size is small.  There are only 80 games that have a temp < 15 and 78 with a temp > 87
7) After running the inital analysis I also took a look to see if snow was influencing but the above sample only appeared to contain 2 games where it was snowing
